## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have a server running PHP and MySQL. Once you have that set up, you can clone this repository and run the necessary composer and npm commands to install the dependencies.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Wansrif/Inertia-Blog.git
<<<<<<< HEAD

  cd Inertia-Blog
  composer install
  npm install
```

After this, you should use the `php artisan key:generate` command to generate this variable's value since the `key:generate` command will use PHP's secure random bytes generator to build a cryptographically secure key for your application.

You will also need to set up the database and run the migrations. You can create a new database and edit the .env file to match your database configuration.

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

Once that's done, you should be able to run the app on your localhost.

```bash
php artisan serve
```
